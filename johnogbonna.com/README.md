This is a bio website for me, John Ogbonna 

It has a custom Ui made from scratch, built using React and SCSS

The purpose of this site is for those who want to get to know me on a more personal level, and see what I'm all about! 

There are several UI elements of varying complexity, such as a gallery, a dropdown on hover Nav Bar and more

This was one of my first major projects!

let me know what you think of the UI elements and layout! Email: johnny.ogb@gmail.com
